# Snippets

A small collaborative project between the users in the [Unofficial Godot Discord server](https://discord.gg/zH7NUgz) to provide useful snippets to beginners.

Each snippet is its own project, able to run on its own, or can be explored through the "snippet explorer" which is at the root.
The snippet explorer also shows the source of the project, and allows for easy copy-pasting.

The project itself is somewhat of a demonstration of background loading and structure. Having nested config.cfg is really not advised in general, but apart from that, the project can be used as a model to build the core game node
